00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good afternoon, everybody. It's Denise here, Denise Duke Journals UK.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Lovely to have you here. It is Saturday book page play.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I'm going to make some of these.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So I've got two different types of book page here. I've got the text book page,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is what I like to use upon these Saturday videos.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I've done a bit of collaging all the way around and then some bigger book pages

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for the centrepiece. I could just collage the whole thing.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I've done previously haven't I, whole collaged booklets.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This time I'm using up my yellow envelopes and some of my yellow envelopes

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and some of the small pieces of book page and some bigger pieces.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So, yeah, I just liked it. It's cute. It's got quite a nice strong cover on it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And of course, you can put anything you want in the centre, in the centre.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I was just thinking it's got a nice piece in the centre.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And yeah, that's the signature. But anything you want as a signature,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you could put more book page in, you could put your book page images and scrap papers.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
OK, so let's make one. We'll definitely make one together.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I will be making more than one, but let's grab a couple of these bright yellow envelopes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I've got about 60 of them, which I won't use up just as envelopes.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's my glue paper. So all I'm going to do is stick them in there like that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so that they fold over each other. Fold that because it needs rearranging a little bit.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:55.000
All I do is I don't do the whole of it in there because it's going to stay put.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's going to be collaged on. So all I need to do really is shut it closed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The collaging and what I'm sticking on it is going to make it stay closed.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, yeah, I didn't need to completely glue the flaps, I think is what I was trying to say.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
OK, so I just wanted that to do a little bit on there to be drying, I guess.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Just get the flap down, that's it, while we get some papers ready.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So I don't know if I've got any papers ripped ready or not.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So I'm just going to grab some out of here because this is what I'm working on.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It is going down a bit and I'm just going to grab some.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It doesn't use an awful lot, lots of these things that I do.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I just want some different variety of colours, basically, and text if possible.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
See if we can use anything off these clipped together ones because I would like to use them first.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I don't really want any of the white papers, I want them more.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Let's see, let's see how we go with those, see if I need more or not.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I need more or not. Oops, a little scratch, oh dear.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And the book that I've brought for these centrepieces is from this Island Diary A Year On.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Is it Estale? I think that might be Estale, it could be Estale.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Gareth and Vicky Waite, I'm sure I've shown you it before. Yes, I know.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It's a beautiful, beautiful book. I am going to use some pages of it in some of my summary journals now.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I bought it and put it away on my book shelf and haven't used it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So it'd be nice to do some sort of March Opal-y ones.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So I don't know about that, I won't use that page.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Oh yeah, that's beautiful.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You know, just so that we've got some booklets for this time of year.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I will probably send these out as freebies with journals, you know, when people buy the bigger journals.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I think these, I'll probably end up making four.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Yes, the next four journals that I sell, we'll get. That's gorgeous, isn't it?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
We'll get one of these in with the package.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I always put a bit of something in, but these are going to be nice to have.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So that's lovely. Yeah, so I want one either side of it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So there'll be one in the middle and one on the outside.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So, yeah, if we have the full page like that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It's kind of, it's written as a diary, like April 1st, April 3rd, talking about the flowers and things like that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah, it's going to be lovely.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
OK, so what do I want? Sort of squarish, I guess.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I bet I have got some of these somewhere, but, you know, I don't know what that noise is.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Someone's just started making a bizarre noise outside.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I hope they're not going to carry on with it.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Right, what have I done with this one that I've made?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Because I haven't made it today.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I haven't made it this week.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I need to remind myself what I did.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I'm just really stuck.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Yeah, so if we go a fair way in, let me see how far the page goes.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yes, I want them to be a good centimetre in, I guess, all around.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I'm going to wrap them over.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
That's nearly two centimetres all the way around.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So I want them about an inch and a half in depth, my pieces.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I do want them right over, don't I? Yeah, much easier.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
OK, so it was moving on those, don't lose that.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Pop those over there, don't leave them there.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Go away with your noise, whatever it is you're doing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
That's the only thing about summer coming, isn't it?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I don't know if it's something gardening wise.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I'm hoping maybe you can't hear it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I do know I need to talk up a little bit because I did notice in my last two videos,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the sound wasn't very high, was it?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Unless it was just that I had it turned down when I was listening,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
because I don't particularly like to listen to myself.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I just do feel the need to check the videos, so I have to listen.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Yeah, I want them all different shapes and sizes, though,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
but I do want them roughly, what did I say?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Four centimetres, yeah, an inch and a half.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So I can probably go in half with that.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And then, you know, have some thinner, some thicker.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Why don't you want to move on there?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
This is very thin paper.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
A couple of finish ones.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Because I kind of want to put different coloured papers together.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So I'm going to try and keep them kind of in their own stack.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I don't really want that drawing.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It'll go in something, but not in this.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This is a really old, I think.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Oh, that's all right on that side.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Yes, what's the name of the children's author?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Inid Blyton.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This is a really old Inid Blyton book.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's very, very thick paper.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So much so that I feel like I've got to.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I have.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I was going to say that was thick.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Right, and what did I say I wanted them?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
About four centimetres, that's 10.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So if I do that that way, that's lovely.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And I'll put some on one way and some on another.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I don't know why I'm doing them with the ruler necessarily, because I like the not straight edges.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Although this one feels a bit like it doesn't want to tear.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So maybe I will continue with the ruler with this one and then some of the others I will tear freehand, which is always good for a laugh, isn't it?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Always cheers you up.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Watching the paper win over me.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I hope you're all well.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Had a lovely week.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It's just crazy to me how quick the weeks are flying, I think, because there's so much going off.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Not sure if that one's big enough that way, but we'll call it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Yeah, so much going off here.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And yeah, I'm just not getting in front.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Trying my hardest, but not to the point that I'm not living life, which is why I'm not getting there.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
If life is here offering me something better, I'll go do it.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But yeah, hopefully I'll get in front soon.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
As you know, I've got electricians coming in.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I thought you weren't going to do that to the Maldonese.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And just take the edges off with that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And other workmen and work, you know, it's going to be three days.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Neil will be at home for two of them, but three days I'm going to have workmen here.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So I'm not going to be able to get into my room first thing.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000
It may be that I end up, you know, when they're done, they often get a job done and go, don't they, workmen?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So I know for two days it will be a quick, you know, they're coming.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I'm going to cut some smaller bits and see, you just don't know.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
They'll be coming in the morning and, you know, they don't expect to be here all day.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
It's just probably about half a day.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So, yeah, I might. But it depends because Neil's home so we might go out afterwards or we might be gluing up afterwards.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But I just might. I just might come and get into my room.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000
This is the same as that one, isn't it? But this is torn, I guess.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yeah, so that's slightly different. What have we got? What have we not got?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
That same as that one. French one didn't have here.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Yes, they don't need too many different. I suppose you need any, because what you could do is if you're just using one book up or two books with similar colour paper or, you know, more modern books,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
so they haven't got the age colour, you could like coffee dye, tea dye, stain them.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000
You could just ink them a bit with your, if you've got, you know, blending ink, Tim Holtz ink, something like that.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000
There are always ways to make, oops, I should have known that would happen, to make a book page in different shades, aren't there?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Yeah, I really should have had these done because half the video is going to be me tearing paper.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So I will stop now and use what I've got and then see if I want, you know, a bigger variety going forward.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I'm just going to grab a little bit of this one. I don't think I've got any, I haven't.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But I shall do it with the ruler, so I'm really quick, then we can get started.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Because I may have to stop and let it dry. The other one, I'm pretty sure, was dry before I just do three straight pieces.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Pretty dry before I added the signature, which is always, always a good idea.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
OK, so we're starting with this. I've got two envelopes, they're fairly thick envelopes and I'm literally just going to go around the edges.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Let's get a glue stick here. Sticking paper over. Now, you could ink them.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
That would also help differentiate them. Try and flatten that blue up a bit.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So I'll start with a big one. I love the colour of this one and the.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000
What do you call it? What do you call the text? The font? That's it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
You need to bear in mind. Maybe I should have drawn.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So I'm just going to grab from various piles and I'm not going to stress about it.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
If I stick two together that are the same colour, I'm not going to let it bother me.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Now, like there, I might go over that with that one.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So literally collaging just the edges, I guess.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
However, you like to collage if they're upside down, which, of course, that one is there.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:29.000
That's not going to bother me either. What I'm going to have to do is I feel like I've done this before on camera.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I mean, obviously I've done it before. I don't think I have.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I think it must have been those other ones I was doing where I am, as I was about to say, need to use my glue paper a bit more sparingly.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
That's what made me have a bit of deja vu.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
OK, so I've got a good selection going on there. Nice tall one here.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Didn't take that top bit off. How did I manage that?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm going to have sticky fingers, though, and like that side better.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Some of these pages, this one, for example, is quite flimsy, so it's.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
It will stick to me and tear.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Not bothered about it being straight either. I'm literally just going to collage.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Now, you could for ease if you wanted to just collage the whole whole thing, couldn't you?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Not mess around the edges, I guess. I think what I will do is I'll do the edges like this and then I'll have a look and see.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I'll do some that way and some that way. Put the pages on off those middle pages on.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And then if I've got places where there's yellow showing, I don't even know which is right way now.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Does it matter? Yeah, I'll just collage the gappy bits, the yellow bits.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So feel free to speed this bit up, because literally all I'm going to do is this for the next 10 minutes, probably five minutes.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I don't know however long, however long it takes.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So, yeah, the work we're having done, I'm sure I've told you, but I might as well tell you again, while I'm sat here doing nothing is...

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Do I want to go across the middle? I think I do.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
We're having, well, a new electric oven installed because mine broke.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:47.000
But to have that done, I need electrics works done behind it because they were not done very well, shall we say, in the previous lifetime before we owned the house.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So we're having, as always, we're having things fixed as we do every time we need to replace, replace, upgrade something.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So we're having some electrics fixed, which means I've had to have tiles off, so I will be having tiling done, but we're not there yet.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Tiles off in the kitchen and a cabinet down in the kitchen because they're going to have to trace into the wall with the wires.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So, yeah, what was just a new oven has turned out to be quite a job.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So we're having that done and they're putting me some new wall sockets in at the same time because I'm very short on sockets, electrical outlets, you know, in the kitchen.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So that will be nice. It's a worktop next to the next to the cooker of my dishwasher that has no sockets, so that'll be lovely.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So I'm having that done and they're replacing some switches that are very old and very ugly, just, you know, thrown on the wall, put on sideways instead of straight.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And, yeah, just not, no care taken really. I like that there. I'll have to put these behind probably, but never mind.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So that's going to be the big job that's going to take a lot of clearing up afterwards because, you know, Neil will have to re-plaster the wall, re-hang the cabinet, kitchen cabinet and everything out of it is all over the place at the moment.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And he will have to, well, we then need to take the rest of the tiles off because they're very old tiles and find some more tiles and tile it.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So that's a long term job. But the other electric jobs we're having done is, which we'd arranged to have done long before the oven broke, a different company and a different electrician.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
We're having, what do you call them?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Fans in the kitchen, in the bathroom that remove the moisture from the air, what on earth are they called?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Sometimes they're called Expel Air, but I think that's just a trade name, you know, a mate.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Goodness me, it won't come to me, but you know what I mean anyway. So we're having extractor fans, that's it.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:38.000
To extract the moist heat, we're having those fitted and the reason we're having those fitted is because we are having cavity wall insulation done and they like to ensure that you're not going to suffer with damp or mould.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
We don't at the moment, but we certainly don't want to.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And I think if you're not, if you don't have air free flowing, what's the word? Ventilated enough.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:02.000
If you're not ventilated enough, I think it's a possibility when you've had your cavity wall, which is between the brick and the, what's the other?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I think you might call them cinder blocks, we call them breeze blocks in the UK.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
When I say you, I mean people not in the UK.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I'm doing all right at the moment, but I might be running out soon of different colours.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Did I have anything here that, no I've got that one, I've got that one.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Let me just have a look.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Just fancy one more different colour, just one, just one short.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Keep pulling the same ones, turn it down so I can see in it.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
What are you?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I mean, they might be similar-ish coloured paper, but it's different sized text, if not a different font.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Yeah, I'm worn out just telling you about all the work, to be honest.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So, yeah, I think that's it, that's what I said.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
The cavity wall itself is not going to take long, I don't think it's just a few hours.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And they're on the outside, not the inside.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:25.000
So that shouldn't be a problem, but it's the electricians inside that's, you know, so to fix my electrics, they're going to have to come up into the bedroom.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Luckily, I haven't carpeted my bedroom with new carpet.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
That's a nice big piece on there.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Yeah, take the, I call them floorboards, but they're not the sheets of something or another.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Pretend wood, I call it. Sheets of pretend wood.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Yeah, trace down the wall from there into the kitchen.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So you can imagine the mess that's going to be going on, I can.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Every time we, that means taking the carpet up. I mean, we were, the intention was to take the carpet up in a couple of weeks anyway, because it's not our carpet.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
We cleaned it when we came in. It's not very nice, it's not wonderful.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And we're having a really huge rug down that is about an inch smaller than the room all the way around.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
It's a carpet that we've had wicked around the edges.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
So it makes it a rug, but actually it's carpet, it's wall carpet.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And I'm going to just paint the floor, fill and paint the floor around the edge bit.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000
So that's kind of bringing that forward as well once they're finished. Luckily, I hadn't done all that.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Let's do that.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
But when it's all done, you know, it will be lovely. It will all be done.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I mean, the kitchen won't be any different, I guess, because, well, it will because I'll have my new sockets, won't I?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And I'll have it that way up.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Just don't want that yellow showing across the edge there, that's it. Nearly there, look, two pieces, do you think?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Oops.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
This one I've just ripped off here.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Well, that's the same one as that one I thought that was. It isn't, so let's have this big piece.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I was going to say there won't be much difference in that because we're kind of replacing the oven, like for like, nothing really expensive or new or flash.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Unfortunately, I can't afford anything big and expensive and flash.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Otherwise, we would be. But yeah, it's just a like for like, just a new Zanussi oven, standard oven.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
That'll do us for a couple of years because we will want the kitchen remodelling anyway in a couple of years.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Hopefully it all goes well. I didn't realise I didn't have anything round there.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So just a little bit somewhere.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Yeah, it'll be perfect. It might be the same as what is next to you.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:20.000
But yeah, I've gone to pot on my glue sheet. I definitely have not been keeping it tidy.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.000
OK. Oh, nope, still one. I've got about that one.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Which way do I want to go? That's quite a big chunk on there.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I haven't got any big chunks, I'll have to tear one.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Let's go that way.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:02.000
I don't know what I've done with that blue page. Let's get rid of it because I'm all over the shop with it.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000
So, yeah, luckily nothing's happening in my craft room, so I haven't got to tidy up, clear out, pack up any of that malarkey in here.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I'm going to go over that hinge bit again. It's good to have a stronger hinge.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I might stick some up the middle of it anyway, just to strengthen it.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Might as well, that's what I was going to say.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I'm hoping when the insulation goes in, the extra insulation, that it will be warmer because it is very cold at the moment here.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Or it feels very cold. It's wind chill, I think.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
I don't know why I'm being so picky because it won't be on show, but that was almost a bit brittle for bending.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I just wanted to give it a bit of extra bendage, really.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.000
If you see what I mean, strength. Strength is what I meant, not bendage.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Right, just a tiny bit there, shy, just a little tiny piece. And it was a piece of this, wasn't it?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
No. Well, I don't suppose it matters. That could go there. Let's do it. Stop being picky.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
So I didn't say how many pages I pulled out, did you? Four or five? Five, maybe.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
So by the time I've used two, I'll probably use them up. So yeah, probably five pages. That's not bad.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Plus this one. This is a book page, so it counts.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Now, we're not going to see that it says April, are we? Just thought about that because it's going around.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000
But when you open it, it will, but even then it'll have a...

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
I'm still going in the middle of it. Or am I? Maybe I'll light that bird on that side.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
No, I'm not. I'm having this one. Let go of me. I'm having this on this side.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
So I think I'm going to do the same and just glue stick it down because it just needs time to dry.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And like with the previous ones I made, I'm going to let it dry open. I'm not going to fold it while it's wet.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
So I guess I'm going to have to do is turn the camera off and come back later.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I'm not going to dry it. I don't think I might put it under the heater.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I'm not going to dry it with the drying machine because it makes it bend.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
But the heater might also make it bend.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.000
What's rattling? Tin somewhere? I've got you on straight.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:55.000
And am I in? Oh, way, way. What are you doing right up there?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Straight enough. I've got a bit of glue going around, but that won't hurt because it'll seal some of the outside edges.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Now, of course, it would be a good idea if you wanted it to last a long time.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Or you're doing it as a proper journal cover to Mod Podge. I say it every time, don't I?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
And seal, somehow seal. Put a bigger coat on.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:28.000
It's a shame we've just got a birds. Might have to put a label there. Birds feet and lower portions.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And I want it down there a little bit, so I'm just going to stick a piece of that in there.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Yeah, so while it's drying, I'll probably stick another two envelopes. Stick them?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Well, I will stick them, but I'll do this to them.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Collage, that's it, collage them. I was thinking because it's got quite a border, you could also go on and do more.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
There's a lot of text on mine, so I won't, but if it was just a picture, you know, just putting bits across here, there and everywhere.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Got little bits left. Building a border would be nice.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I won't, but on this particular one.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I don't want to do a master board as well for something.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I want to make some embellishments that I want to make out of book page master board.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So I won't be doing it on camera, but I'll do one and then I'll show you.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I'll show you what I do with it. I'm sure the majority of you know how to make a master board.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
And if you don't, there's lots of videos out there. I've got loads, I'm sure.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I'm sure I did a series at one point about master. Yeah, I did master board Monday.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
So those videos will be out there somewhere.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Would be nice inked or gold round it, something to create a.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
What's the word? Not border, but that kind of thing.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
The word that means border around it as well.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
So, yeah, I'm going to let that dry because you get a much nicer bend when when it's dry first.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
What I did on this one was put some lace down it.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I don't think I reinforced. I didn't reinforce it anymore.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
You know, like I did that one and I put lace down, but I probably will anyway.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Put lace down it as well. I've got some lovely pink here as well as the greens.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
I think the greens might go better. I've got a different green look.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Just stitched it in. Like I say, I'll get some papers together and we'll do one.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
As soon as this is dry, I'll come back on and do it with you.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
And hopefully it won't take too long. And yeah, I'll see you.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
See you when it's dry. Blow on it. Take a second. And here they are.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Well, the sun came out and I closed my curtain and it was absolutely so bright I couldn't see.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And it's gone. It's gone and there's a black cloud now.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
So I don't know. It looks like we're in for some rain.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
The sun obviously tried and couldn't couldn't make it.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
OK, there's the one that we made together, April. I've stitched around it.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
I had green in my machine, so I left it in. Really like it. Quite tactile.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Yeah, quite thick. Nice. And this is another one that I did.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Not quite as dry, but it's dry enough. It was dry enough.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I don't think I'll bend this one yet, but it was dry enough to sew on.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
And I just wanted to share with you this page from the book.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000
April the 6th, Palm Sunday. Found Vicky sitting on the bank.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Painting what are those? Selendynes? Selendynes? I think they're some kind of flower, aren't they?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
The sun was intensely bright and the picked blooms were casting deep shadows on the paper.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Annabella, the donkey, has free range over the island.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
She is inquisitive and will quietly overtake one who is walking.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Giving a friendly nip to the coat or shirt, she stands watching her reflection in the cottage windows.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Today, she approached the headland and stood gazing out towards Mull, as if wondering if others of her kind resided there.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Mr. B, our neighbour, whose garden comprises only two daffodils, lost one of them today.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And now, I don't know, but I'm thinking the donkey. I might be wrong.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Is it because the donkey trod what? Maybe? I don't know.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
But yeah, I love that. Love the picture of it as well.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And on this side, it's the pansies and some kind of a poem about them. Beautiful.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Oh, yeah. Selendynes, look. Selendynes. That's what they are.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
So are they a type of pansy, maybe? Don't know.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Anyway, stop. Stop. Get inside, Tractone.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
So I've put some papers together to put in them to put a signature together.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
I'm doing this one, not that one. That one's not quite dry enough yet.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
So what have we got on here? We've got red. So I'm going to go with this one.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
So all I've pulled together are just some pages that seemed the right size that I didn't have to mess about with.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.000
So I have got. So it's A5, I'm guessing, because that's one of my A5.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Embossed. That's it. Embossed papers.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.000
This is two pages from that William Morris wine book, a page from my vintage cash book,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000
a page from a vintage, what do you call that? Squares? Graph? I don't know.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Something like that. Graph book, a page of lovely vellum and a page.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
It's white on the back, but I don't mind just, you know, an odd white page in here.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
It's just beautiful for the middle, I thought. I don't know how many I had.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This one's particularly thick.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
It's like a it's like a cover in itself, but I thought it would be nice, nice to have in there.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Those bubbles hurt your fingers. That's it. So let's fold them all over, put them together.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And so this one in and then the other one I will sew in off camera.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:43.000
And like I say, so that will be three. The next three journals that I sell, I will pop one of these in with them.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000
It's a little extra something. I'm just leaving those out of laziness.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Those little, what are they called? Yes. Didgeridoos.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
I don't know. I don't know what you call them actually. Those little bits of paper.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:13.000
On the end. I want these legs to be in the middle. Silly girl.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000
OK. As soon as it's white, I love it. It's not an ASMR video.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Sorry for the noise. It doesn't look white now, does it?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000
It's got the vellum on it. I'm going to put those two white pages together.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:48.000
I don't know why, just because.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
I'm not going to trim them round and make them all identical.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
You know, as your pages from the middle go towards the middle, they come out more.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
But that's how they're staying. I'm going to sew it in.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
So beautiful. I mean, the lovely writing boards are journal cards.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
You know, if I just used a single envelope, it would be lovely.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm still not sure if this one's dry enough yet.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
I like it crispy dry, if you see what I mean.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Try and try and do it gently. So we are.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Twenty three, so that is eleven and a half centimetres is roughly the middle,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:46.000
which is right on one of those. So I'm going to go. Was it there?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Eleven and a half. Oh, it is there.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:01.000
So either the front might be a millimetre, the most longer or what is it?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
A sixteenth of an inch, an eighth of an inch. I don't know.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
OK, that's that's given me a bit of something to. That's better.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Yeah, that helped a lot. I'm not fighting it.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
You know, I'm not being too rough. Just trying to persuade it.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
I'm going to put some lace on it. Like I say, it's a shame that April couldn't be seen.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:38.000
But it says ill. You can look at it like that.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
So yeah, I'm just going to sew these in and then put some lace down.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
And then, like I say, I'll just put that little clip through some pretty pink.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Have I not got me? I thought I had them out. No, I haven't.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Yeah, let's go with some bright pink. Embrace the summer feel, even if the sun's deserted me.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
That's been out a little bit today. So am I going to do a three? I think I will.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Whoops. I don't know what I was doing there. So three times the length.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Roughly and a tiny bit more. I can see my brad at my brad at all.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Needle. There we go.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Here we go. No, that's a hair grip. I can see it.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:42.000
I just can't make me fingers pick it up. That's it thrown itself at me.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Don't be splitting on me. OK, I'm not going to clip it.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I'm just going to, you know, do what I do best.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:03.000
We need to go from must have gone from the outside on that one to leave the.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I'm going to go inside there. I don't want them on the outside of this.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
I've decided. Can you all stay in place while I do this?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
That would be very kind of you. Not you guys, not the viewers, the papers.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So, yeah, I am going through all the paper with quite a thick needle.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
So the lace on the outside will definitely be. Did you all move them?

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Felt like you did. Yeah, we'll definitely be a good idea to save.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
You know, give it a bit of strength, a bit of longevity.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I'm loving that pink with a pink paper in the middle.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
It's lovely and thick that where I put the extra layer in the middle.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Why have you not come through? Where are you residing?

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
You've gone somewhere. Oh, straight through the back.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Missed the papers. Exactly right.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And have to do it like this on through the wire there.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
So go through that first.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Sometimes it's the best way to go.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And now we'll go through this, hopefully in one go.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
But if we have to take it apart, we will.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.000
It could be because I haven't clipped it, but sometimes I clip it and the same thing happens.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
I'm through there, I'm through there.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Are we through everywhere? No.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Come on. Ouch, that was it.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Felt it slip through.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
So one either side. Yeah, I love that pink. So cheerful.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000
As I don't want a long, I'll make it even though.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:07.000
I don't want a long string on it, but life's easier if everything's more equal before you start.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Yeah, nice and strong. I think these bows will be pretty in the middle.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
We'll just do two knots.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
I could just, yeah, let's just cut them off and have dangles.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Won't be in the way then. So yeah, it is quite thick. That's not what I'm using.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
That's what I'm using. They put quite thick papers in it.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
But I think I probably did with the other one. That's why I ended up with one of those little clips on it.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Oh no, this is the one that's off it.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
And it has actually flattened it quite a lot anyway, but it might as well stay on.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I do have some more of those somewhere.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
I'll put this on.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
I've pulled off there a bit of paper. Beware of some.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
And since I've used pink, I'll have to use the pink piece of this.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
I was going to go with green, but

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
did I go all the way along? I did.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
But I don't know if I want to with this one. I might just do the inside the stitching.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
I didn't stitch around that one, you see.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
That one's got bling.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
The lace can be the bling on here.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000
That doesn't mean I won't stick a piece on, quite likely to.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Yeah, it's nice and see through lace.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:47.000
You can still see the words if you read in the cover.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Put some on this because it will protect it from cracking a little.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I don't want it too lumpy.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
I think I'll have the love hearts on the back, just the pink.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Pink frill on the front like that.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And then more of it over the back with those love hearts.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Where did we come to?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000
I was stuck up to high heaven, my fingers, when I finished the last part of the video.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
I had to really scrub my hands with soap and water.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
And now I'm stuck up again with Fabri-Tac.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Does come off easier than, Fabri-Tac comes off easier if you rub it.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And this stuff, what's that? Glue stick.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Yeah, I might, I might put a label on there because.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
I should have put it under there though, shouldn't I really?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Because of the ill, I only said might, might not.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Let's see what we've got.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
How pretty is that look? It's a sticker.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Is it?

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Don't ask us, we don't know.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
I don't know.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
It is.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
I'm just going to stick it on.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
I'm not messing with any more glue.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Straight would be good.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Is it blended?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
I just want a few little threads on there, I don't mind if I've got anything.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
In my magic box.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.000
We're going with pink, shall we use a bit of this gorgeous sari?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I don't know where this came from, it must have been round a, oh that's a nice pink bit.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
It must have been around something that I was sent, it must have been.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
It's absolutely gorgeous, I would like loads of it.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:09.000
So if you sent me it, if you sent me something wrapped up in it, let me know where you got it from.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
One of those bigger ones, let me see.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Just let me reach.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
These are these, aren't they?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.000
What are they called, I don't know.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:36.000
They're like clipboard clips, aren't they, whereas these are like bulldog clips.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Now I know on the other one I've got much thinner stuff so it falls down, but I just like this.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Just caught my eye, come on.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Let's go with it.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Of course if you was adding it to a journal or something you might not want this, this big clip on it.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:08.000
You could put a fancy paper clip on it, or you could just put it under a big book until it behaved itself.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
OK.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Lovely. Yeah, so I will create one more with this.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
And like I say, there'll be presents.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:33.000
I hope you enjoyed seeing that. Let me know if you make anything similar or what you're up to, what you're making.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I will see you tomorrow for Scrappy Sunday. Hopefully I will get to my scrappy journal and we'll start using some scraps up in there.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
That would be nice. Have a lovely what's left of Saturday and I'll see you all soon. Bye for now.
