00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
We are learning new details about the relationship between Fulton County D.A. Fonny Willis and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.720
Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.160
Lawyers for former President Trump examined Wade's cell phone records and found 2,000

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.879
voice calls and nearly 12,000 text messages between Willis and Wade over an 11-month period

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:20.760
in 2021.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.840
There were also 35 times during which Wade's cell phone was close to two cell towers in

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.120
Hapeville, near where Willis had a condo.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.160
During last week's hearing, Wade admitted to visiting Willis in Hapeville, but he said

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.200
he only visited 10 times before he was hired as a Special Prosecutor.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.759
The cell phone records appear to contradict that testimony.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:49.720
If Willis and Wade were a couple before he was hired, it raises concerns about anti-nepotism

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720
rules.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.599
They could be dated before 2022, as their sworn testimony claims they could be at risk

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:57.759
of perjury.
